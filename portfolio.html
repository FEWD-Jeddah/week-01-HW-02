                        <h4 >  A female giraffe normally gives birth to one calf at a time.
                             After a calf is born, it stays close to its mother. A giraffe is one of 
                             the few animals that are born with horns. Most other hoofed mammals with 
                             horns grow their horns when they are older. A calf grows very quickly. In 
                             its first year, it can grow 1 inch a week. By its first birthday, the calf 
                             may be about 10 feet tall!
